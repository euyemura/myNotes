# Increase the odds of getting an interview.  

The best way to get a job is getting through the door as much as possible.

We want around a 1%-5% interview rate.

Interviewing is absolutely a numbers game.  You just need the right one at some point, even after 100 applications.

1. Resume
2. LinkedIn
3. Portfolio
4. Email

This should take about a week all in all to optimize these if you are starting from square one.

## Resume

This is the thing that deems whether you are even worth the time to talk to, for an initial phone screen even. Or for them to send you a coding challenge to get you to that phone screen.

They are simply a way to get interviews.

Make it personal for each job you apply to.... Oops.

resumemaker.online  is a great resume templating tool, unless you are a designer this is a great way to go.

This will help you format your resume.

A lot of times humans don't even look at your resume, they have algorithms looking for keywords.

So tailor your resume for keywords!

Make it look personal, even though it may be a robot, that doesnt mean rewriting it entirely however.  Maybe change the headline at the top to talk about why you would be great for the job.  

### Resume CheatSheet

✅ Use a pre-designed resume template
✅ Make the resume fit on 1 page
✅ Include words from job description
✅ Include company name you are applying to
✅ Does your first item on your resume reflect what they are looking for?
✅ Experience titles demonstrate value
✅ Do you have an online link?
✅ Remove the word “I”
✅ No buzzwords describing how great you are
✅ Are you using Action words?
✅ Measure everything in terms of impact, don’t just describe your responsibilities
✅ Technical Knowledge/Skills should include what they are looking for. Only show years if it is impressive
✅ Include only sections/items that are impressive: Experience, Projects, Education, Technical Skills
✅ No typos or bad grammar

### What if I don't have enough experience?

Well you should be applying to jobs that you dont feel quite qualified for, because you want to be learning more.

Also, these job postings are trying to weed out junior developers from applying, or super inexperienced juniors.  Every application should be a longshot so that you can learn a lot at that job.

Make sure to link your projects, your github, your website.

Github: contribute to open source projects.
