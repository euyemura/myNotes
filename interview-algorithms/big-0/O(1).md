So we just learned O(n), but lets talk about the next one.

```javascript
function compressFirstBox(boxes){
  console.log(boxes[0]);
}
```
-----------------------------

```ruby
def compress_first_box(boxes)
  puts boxes[0]
end
```

In this function up above, no matter how big the input is, or how many elements in the boxes array, nothing really changes as we are only performing one operation, logging the first element of the array.

So the O notaion would be, O(1) --> constant time.

No matter how many boxes, we are just getting the first item, it'll take the same amount of time, or it'll only be performing one operation.  Remember, O notation is how many operations per elements, for this, 1 operation, no matter how many elements.

```javascript
const boxes = [0,1,2,3,4,5]

function logFirstTwoBoxes(boxes) {
  console.log(boxes[0]);
  console.log(boxes[1]);
}

logFirstTwoBoxes(boxes)
```

So this would be, O(2), two operations still a constant time. And so on and so forth, still constant time.

As long as it's still constant, it doesnt matter how big that n integer grows, it's still constant, so its still represented as O(1), even if its technically O(5), write it as O(1)

EXERCISE: BIG O CALCULATION

I think it was supposed to be O(1).

```javascript
function funChallenge(input) {
  let a = 10; //O(1)
  a = 50 + 3; //O(1)

    for (let i = 0; i < input.length; i++) {
      //O(n) loops are linear time
      anotherFunction(); //O(n)
      let stranger = true; //O(n)
      a++; //O(n) all of these are O(n) because
    }
    return a; //O(1) this only happens once every time the function runs.
}

// All the O(1) add up, so 3, then we have 4 O(n), so our notation is this, Big O(3 + 4n)
```

BIG O(3 + 4n) --> O(n) is what it boils down to. Interesting

```javascript
// What is the Big O of the below function? (Hint, you may want to go line by line)
function anotherFunChallenge(input) {
  let a = 5; //O(1)
  let b = 10; //O(1)
  let c = 50; //O(1)
  for (let i = 0; i < input; i++) { //O(n)
    let x = i + 1; //O(n)
    let y = i + 2; //O(n)
    let z = i + 3; //O(n)

  }
  for (let j = 0; j < input; j++) { //O(n)
    let p = j * 2; //O(n)
    let q = j * 2; //O(n)
  }
  let whoAmI = "I don't know"; //O(1)
}
```

We have 4 O(1)'s, and 7 O(n);s, so its BIG O(4 + 7n) or O(4 + 5n)
