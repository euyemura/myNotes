# searching

## Linear Search

Looks through a list sequentially until it finds what it is looking for, just a loop.

Best case, O(1), worst case, O(N)

## Binary searching

Well, what if the list is sorted? Start from the middle, and then based on what is bigger than or smaller than, then go to left or right, do it again.

This is what we talked about for binary search trees, and even merge sort. This would be a O(log N ) time. This is binary search.
